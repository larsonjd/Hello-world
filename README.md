# Hello-world
A time-honored tradition

Hi Humans!

Josh here, I am new to programming, but I've always wanted to learn.
I've picked up a couple resources on Python and will learn from there.
I've started this GitHub profile to track my progress and learn about the community.

This is a basic list of project ideas I have.
I'm going to store the ideas here in this "Hello-world" file.
That way it looks as if I'm being more active than I actually am while I learn how this all works.
Judge all you want no one is actually reading this aside from me.
If you are reading this HI!!!
Thank you for taking the time out of your day and reading my work.
I hope your day is going amazing and that your life is blessed!
If you would like to add fun ideas for me to possibly code on my journey please feel free to let me know!!

Project Ideas

1) DnD style game, this will be quite intensive, but I've always wanted a fully interactive automated DM
  -uploading the entire DnD 5e handbooks into a dictionary to pull stats from and semi-randomly generated encounters
2) A calander app
  -Implementing a text-message-based method to ad "to-dos" and "events"
3) An app to research good stocks to invest in
  - Ideally it will pull data and track trends to indicate stocks that are most likely to increase over : a day, month, year, and decade
4) Complete The Odin Project
5) Complete the three Python courses
