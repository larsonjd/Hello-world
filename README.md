# Hello-world
A time-honored tradition

Hi Humans!

Josh here, I am new to programming, but I've always wanted to learn.
I've picked up a couple resources on Python and will learn from there.
I've started this GitHub profile to track my progress and learn about the community.

This is a basic list of project ideas I have.
I'm going to store the ideas here in this "Hello-world" file.
That way it looks as if I'm being more active than I actually am while I learn how this all works.
Judge all you want no one is actually reading this aside from me.
If you are reading this HI!!!
Thank you for taking the time out of your day and reading my work.
I hope your day is going amazing and that your life is blessed!

Project Ideas

1) DnD style game, this will be quite intensive, but I've always wanted a fully interactive automated DM
2) A calander app
3) An app to research good stocks to invest in
